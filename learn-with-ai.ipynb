      "[Music] good morning everybody and welcome back to exploring aws now this morning what i want to talk about is regions and availability zones so there's a lot more to amazon's infrastructure than just those two things but those are kind of the two important things that you're really going to want to know when you're thinking about deploying things to the cloud so let me just grab my pen here really really quick and we'll just kind of draw a quick quick whiteboard session here before we take a look at it so amazon has multiple regions across the globe now these regions are not necessarily a specific data center what they've done is they've said okay we're going to pick a geographical location where we can have a cluster of data centers so let's just say that this region is northern virginia okay in northern virginia there may be multiple data centers that are spread across the northern virginia geographical area and each one of these data centers would be a separate availability zone so when you see availability zone or az that's equivalent to a data center living within that region within that area so amazon may have four or five availability zones or four or five data centers within that geographical region of northern virginia or northern canada or wherever it may be now if you head over to aws.amazon.com you can see the url here and you scroll down about three quarters of the way you're gonna see a map now you can click load more that'll bring you to another page you will have the same map on it with just a little bit more of a breakdown of of different different uh different things right at different different categories and what the different options are but that's not what i'm after at the moment so if i come over here and i find the northern virginia region again you'll see geographically there are six availability zones or six data centers within northern virginia within that region that i could use now i can spread my workloads across all six data centers if i want to in fact my web application that we're using within this demo is spread across two different availability zones or two different data centers so i have you know a web server in one data center i have a web server in another data center i have backend database services in each data center i have an efs share in each data center so this is how you can figure out where and how you want to spread your data you might want to have you know some of your data in northern virginia you may want to try to have another account or some other data in another availability zone or in another region so you can you can use this map to figure out where and what region you're going to be able to put your data in and also how many data centers do you have as an option so for example in northern virginia i have six availability zones but over in ohio i only have three so maybe i want to pick northern virginia you know u.s east as my availability zone because first of all it's geographically going to be located where the bulk of my users are where my maybe corporate office is or it's going to give me more availability zones to replicate my data or to spread my load across so this is where you're going to really really going to start to make some decisions on where your data is and where it's going to be and these little orange bubbles here these are going to be data centers or regions that are coming soon amazon is in the process of building out data centers to um in the process of building out data centers within that region now if i come over here to documentation i'm going to click documentation and we'll click documentation again this is where you can find all of the different you know how-to articles and references api guides all that kind of stuff i'm going to go ahead and i'm going to click on amazon ec2 for compute and there's one more thing that i want to do i'm going to click on user guide for linux instances so we'll go ahead and click here and i'm going to come down to regions and zones this is where i just want to break this down a little bit further for you because again you might be studying for you know your cloud practitioner exam you want reading material you don't have to go out and necessarily uh you know have to do all this discovery everything within this everything within amazon is is readily available for you to just go and read through so you can come down here you can click on regions and it'll kind of explain exactly what i've said to you so a region is a geographical location and you'll have a region here so within the same region you may have u.s east one u.s uh you know this may be eu west one so you may have different regions and then different availability zones within that region then we'll click on availability zones and it kind of breaks that out for you and kind of explains exactly what we're looking for now you can also find a list of availability zones from amazon you can find a list of all the availability zones that are available to you and again this will break down exactly what local zones are within that availability zone etc so this is a really really good place for you to come and read and actually see you know how amazon has broken out its infrastructure and again i highly encourage you to come and read through this or at least look through it so that you understand where you're going to put your data before you get started okay so before you go and start turning on ec2 instances and you know it's obviously going to ask you and we'll get to that in a later video what region you know what what availability zone you want to turn this ec2 instance on in you want to have an understanding of where you're putting that server or where you're putting those those services before you click next and submit all right so hope you guys enjoyed this video i'll see you guys in the next one \n"

    "#### Now that we have the full transcript of the YouTube video, we can proceed to utilize open-source models for natural language processing tasks, such as summarization, translation, and more. These models will help us to extract valuable insights from the transcript.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### We will be using the Transformers library from Hugging Face 游뱅. By using pretrained models, we can significantly reduce our compute costs and carbon footprint - and we can save valuable time and resources that would otherwise be required to train a model from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Let's assume that English is not our first language, and we would like to translate the YouTube transcript to Spanish. To achieve this, we can utilize a pretrained machine learning model specifically designed for translation. Translation involves converting a sequence of text from one language to another. It is a task that can be formulated as a sequence-to-sequence problem. By leveraging a pretrained sequence-to-sequence translation model, we can effectively translate the YouTube transcript from English to Spanish."

      "[M칰sica] Buenos d칤as a todos y bienvenidos de nuevo a explorar aws ahora esta ma침ana de lo que quiero hablar es de regiones y zonas de disponibilidad as칤 que hay mucho m치s para la infraestructura de Amazon que s칩lo esas dos cosas, pero esas son una especie de las dos cosas importantes que realmente vas a querer saber cuando est치s pensando en desplegar cosas en la nube, as칤 que perm칤tanme tomar mi pluma aqu칤 realmente muy r치pido y vamos a dibujar una r치pida sesi칩n de pizarra blanca aqu칤 antes de echar un vistazo as칤 queamazon tiene m칰ltiples regiones en todo el mundo ahora estas regiones no son necesariamente un centro de datos espec칤fico lo que han hecho es que han dicho bien vamos a elegir una ubicaci칩n geogr치fica donde podemos tener un grupo de centros de datos as칤 que vamos a decir que esta regi칩n es la virginia del norte bien en la virginia del norte puede haber m칰ltiples centros de datos que se extienden por el 치rea geogr치fica de la virginia del norte y cada uno de estos centros de datos ser칤a una zona de disponibilidad separada por lo que cuando se ve disponiblety zone o az que es equivalente a un centro de datos que vive dentro de esa regi칩n dentro de esa zona tan amazon puede tener cuatro o cinco zonas de disponibilidad o cuatro o cinco centros de datos dentro de esa regi칩n geogr치fica del norte de virginia o canada norte o donde quiera que sea ahora si te diriges a aws.amazon.com puedes ver la url aqu칤 y te desplazas hacia abajo alrededor de tres cuartos de la forma en que vas a ver un mapa ahora puedes hacer clic en cargar m치s que te llevar치 a otra p치gina tendr치s el mismo mapa en 칠l con s칩lo unUn poco m치s de un desglose de diferentes diferentes uh diferentes cosas derecho en diferentes diferentes categor칤as y cu치les son las diferentes opciones, pero eso no es lo que estoy buscando en este momento, as칤 que si vengo aqu칤 y encuentro la regi칩n de Virginia del Norte de nuevo ver치s geogr치ficamente hay seis zonas de disponibilidad o seis centros de datos dentro de Virginia del Norte dentro de esa regi칩n que podr칤a utilizar ahora puedo distribuir mis cargas de trabajo a trav칠s de los seis centros de datos si quiero de hecho mi aplicaci칩n web que we're usar dentro de esta demo se extiende a trav칠s de dos zonas de disponibilidad diferentes o dos centros de datos diferentes por lo que tengo que saber que un servidor web en un centro de datos tengo un servidor web en otro centro de datos tengo servicios de base de datos de backend en cada centro de datos tengo una cuota de efs en cada centro de datos as칤 que as칤 es como puedes averiguar d칩nde y c칩mo quieres difundir tus datos que tal vez quieras saber algunos de tus datos en el norte de Virginia es posible que quieras intentar tener otra cuenta o algunos otros datos en another zona de disponibilidad o en otra regi칩n por lo que puede utilizar este mapa para averiguar d칩nde y qu칠 regi칩n vas a ser capaz de poner sus datos y tambi칠n cu치ntos centros de datos tiene como una opci칩n, por ejemplo, en el norte de Virginia tengo seis zonas de disponibilidad, pero en Ohio s칩lo tengo tres, as칤 que tal vez quiero elegir el norte de Virginia u.s este como mi zona de disponibilidad porque en primer lugar geogr치fica va a estar situado donde la mayor parte de mis usuarios est치n donde mi tal vez corporativo office es o va a darme m치s zonas de disponibilidad para replicar mis datos o para difundir mi carga a trav칠s de as칤 que aqu칤 es donde realmente vas a realmente va a empezar a tomar algunas decisiones sobre d칩nde est치n sus datos y d칩nde va a ser y estas peque침as burbujas naranjas aqu칤 van a ser centros de datos o regiones que vienen pronto Amazon est치 en el proceso de construir centros de datos a um en el proceso de construir centros de datos dentro de esa regi칩n ahora si vengo aqu칤 a la documentaci칩n estoyvamos a hacer clic en la documentaci칩n y vamos a hacer clic en la documentaci칩n de nuevo aqu칤 es donde se puede encontrar todos los diferentes c칩mo los art칤culos y referencias api gu칤as todo ese tipo de cosas que voy a seguir adelante y voy a hacer clic en Amazon ec2 para calcular y hay una cosa m치s que quiero hacer voy a hacer clic en la gu칤a de usuario para linux instancias as칤 que vamos a seguir adelante y hacer clic aqu칤 y voy a venir a las regiones y zonas aqu칤 es donde s칩lo quiero romper esto un poco m치s abajo para ustedporque de nuevo usted puede estar estudiando para usted sabe que su examen del practicante de la nube usted quiere material de lectura usted no tiene que salir y necesariamente uh usted sabe tiene que hacer todo este descubrimiento todo dentro de este todo dentro de amazona es est치 f치cilmente disponible para usted ir y leer a trav칠s as칤 que usted puede venir aqu칤 usted puede hacer clic en las regiones y va a tipo de explicar exactamente lo que he dicho a usted as칤 que una regi칩n es una ubicaci칩n geogr치fica y usted tendr치 una regi칩n aqu칤 as칤 dentro de la misma regi칩n usted puede tener u.s este uno u.s uh usted sabe que esto puede ser eu oeste uno por lo que puede tener diferentes regiones y luego diferentes zonas de disponibilidad dentro de esa regi칩n entonces vamos a hacer clic en las zonas de disponibilidad y que tipo de se rompe que para usted y tipo de explica exactamente lo que estamos buscando ahora tambi칠n se puede encontrar una lista de zonas de disponibilidad de Amazon se puede encontrar una lista de todas las zonas de disponibilidad que est치n disponibles para usted y de nuevo esto se desglosa exactamente lo que las zonas locales est치n dentro de esa zona de disponibilidad, etces un muy buen lugar para que vengas y leas y realmente veas que sabes c칩mo Amazon ha roto su infraestructura y de nuevo te animo a que vengas y leas a trav칠s de esto o al menos lo veas para que entiendas d칩nde vas a poner tus datos antes de empezar bien as칤 que antes de ir y empezar a encender las instancias de ec2 y sabes que obviamente te va a preguntar y llegaremos a eso en un video posterior qu칠 regi칩n sabes qu칠 zona de disponibilidad quieres girar estoinstancia de ec2 en usted quiere tener una comprensi칩n de donde usted est치 poniendo ese servidor o donde usted est치 poniendo esos servicios antes de que haga clic en el siguiente y enviar bien as칤 que espero que ustedes disfrutaron de este v칤deo los ver칠 en el siguiente\n"

      "There's a lot more to amazon's infrastructure than just regions and availability zones. There may be multiple data centers that are spread across the northern virginia geographical area. Each one of these data centers would be a separate availability zone. If you head over to aws.amazon.com you can see the url here and you scroll down about three quarters of the way you're gonna see a map now you can click load more that'll bring you to another page. There are six availability zones or six data centers within northern virginia within that region that i could use. You can use this map to figure out where and what region you're going to be able to put your data in and also how many data centers do you have as an option. For example in northern virginia i have six availability zones but over in ohio i only have three so maybe i want to pick northern virginian u.s east as my availability zone. Amazon is in the process of building out data centers within that region now if i come over here to documentation i'm going to click documentation and we'll click documentation again this is where you can find all of the different you know how-to articles and references. Everything within amazon is is readily available for you to just go and read through so you can come down here you can click on regions and it'll kind of explain exactly what i've said to you. You can also find a list of availability zones from amazon and again this will break down exactly what local zones are within that availability zone etc. This is a really really good place for you. to come and read and actually see you know how amazon has broken out its infrastructure . it so that you understand where you're going to put your data before you get started okay so hope you guys enjoyed this video i'll see you guys in the next one.\n"

I'm going to click Amazon ec2 for A region is a geographic location and you will have a region here as well within the sameRegion you can have u.s. this one u.S uh you know that this can be eu west one so I can have diregions and then Amazon diff you have broken your infrastructure and again I encourage you to come and read through this or at least see it so that you understand where you're going to put your data before you start well so I hope you enjoyed this video I'll see you in the next one.\n"

      "In this session on AWS infrastructure, the focus is on understanding regions and availability zones (AZs). AWS has multiple global regions, each containing several data centers, with each data center representing an availability zone. For example, the Northern Virginia region has six availability zones, allowing users to distribute workloads for redundancy and performance. Users can check the AWS website for a map of regions and availability zones to decide where to deploy their data based on geographical proximity and the number of available zones. The discussion also highlights the importance of documentation for further guidance on using AWS services, specifically referencing Amazon EC2 for compute resources. In this video, the speaker emphasizes the importance of understanding AWS regions and availability zones for cloud practitioners. A region is a geographical area, such as \"US East 1\" or \"EU West 1,\" which contains multiple availability zones. The speaker encourages viewers to explore AWS documentation to familiarize themselves with this infrastructure before launching services like EC2 instances. Knowing the location of your data is crucial, and the resources provided by AWS can help clarify these concepts. \n"
